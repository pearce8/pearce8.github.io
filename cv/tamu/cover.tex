Dear Search Committee,

I am writing to apply to the position of Professor of Practice in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Texas A\&M University.  I am currently a Computer Scientist in the Center for Applied Computer Science (CASC) at the Lawrence Livermore National University (LLNL).  Previously, I earned my Ph.D. with Dr. Nancy Amato at TAMU.

My vision is to create a learning environment that resembles the multidisciplinary teams across the nation's finest industrial and research institutions,
fully engaging the students' imagination and ability to solve problems individually and as a team.

My experience to date has laid the foundation for these goals.  I earned my doctorate at TAMU under Dr. Nancy Amato, where I developed parallel algorithms and data structures.
On the basis of this work, I received a fellowship at LLNL to finish writing my dissertation, under the supervision of Dr. Bronis de Supinski.
During the fellowship, I developed load balancing algorithms for full scale simulations, along with models to make decisions on when and how to load balance.

Upon graduation, I started a staff position in CASC, and ...

I believe my national lab experience would contribute to the diverse research environment in the CSE department at TAMU, and I would be excited to form collaborations with several groups thoughout the University.
