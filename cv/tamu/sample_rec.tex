It is my pleasure to recommend Olga Pearce for the Professor of Practice position at Texas A\&M University.
. . . about the recommender here ...
I have known Olga through conference committee work for nearly a decade, and have worked closely with her over the past year on the Hatchet project.


Olga is the PI for the Hatchet project, a performance analysis tool that enables users to programmatically compare multiple performance profiles, and write their own analysis.  Hatchet is a young two year old project, but has already attracted multiple collaborators.




intro paragraph. first sentence: it is my pleasure to recommend xxx for the position xxx at xxx. (the recommender will edit the sentence but it's good to have a starter) Then the rest of the paragraph introduces the writer and their qualifications. Why are they qualified to recommend you and in what context. How long have you worked together or known each other This is hard for you to draft. I would just do my best and let the writer fill in the rest


several paragraphs describing the work you have done and its impact. It is good to give examples like papers or software. Think of two or three things that you think academics would think is important: publication record, teaching/mentoring experience, research impact or software. Then describe achievements in those areas. Call out specific papers and their topics that you think are good, etc.Then usually a sentence that you can follow up if you have any questions
