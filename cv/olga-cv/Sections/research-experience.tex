		{Worked on load balancing a multi-physics simulation via domain repartitioning
		and domain replication.  Devised techniques to cheaply estimate processor loads and decide
		when a load imbalance needs to be corrected.  Incorporated multi-constraint
		repartitioning (data parallelism) and domain replication (task parallelism)
		as a way to correct imbalance.
