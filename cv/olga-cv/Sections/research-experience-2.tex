		%{Developing a framework for asynchronous scalable correction of application load imbalance}
		{\begin{itemize}
            \item Developed a model for selection of load
                  balancing algorithms for a given simulation state.%~\cite{pearce:ics12}.
            \item Developed a fast \& accurate load balance method for highly non-uniform density N-Body simulations.
                   %, based on adaptive sampling.%~\cite{pearce:ics14}.
            \item Developed a tool for decoupling \& offloading load balance computation,
                  enabling lazy load balancing.%~\cite{pearce:ipdps16}.
			      %\item Developed an application-independent load model and metrics;
			%\item Developed an algorithmic methodology for deciding {\em when} and {\em how} to correct application imbalance;
			%\item Developed a fast and accurate method of assigning and load balancing interactions in N-body applications;
			%\item Developed a framework for decoupling load balance algorithm resources from the application;
			%\item Developed a framework for offloading \& overlapping load balance computation with application execution;
			%\item Applied work to several large physics applications at LLNL.

		{\begin{itemize}
			\item Developed distributed data structures, parallel algorithms,
				and adaptive algorithm selection methods
				in the Standard Template Adaptive Parallel Library (STAPL),
			  	a parallel superset of the C++ STL. %~\cite{tanase:ppopp11,buss:systor10,tanase:lcpc09}.
              			%Implemented and optimized a parallel vector.
				%~\cite{thomas:ppopp05}.
			\item Designed lock-free containers for multi-threaded programming.
			%\item Working on a general scheduler and partitioner for STAPL, which will
			%be used to schedule and load-balance various applications using STAPL.
			\item Developed a Dynamic Graph Composition Library for updating graph metrics of large, dynamic graphs.

		{\begin{itemize}
			\item Designed techniques to cheaply estimate processor loads and decide
				when to rebalance a simulation.  
			\item Designed load balancing techniques for multi-physics simulations,
				including multi-constraint domain repartitioning (data parallelism)
				and domain replication (task parallelism).
